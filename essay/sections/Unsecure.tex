\section{The Unsecure module}\label{sec:unsecure}
The \texttt{Unsecure} module makes sure an input value will be validated before its use. Listing~\ref{lst:unsecure} shows the definition.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Unsecure module}, label={lst:unsecure}]
type ValidationFunctions a b =
  [a -> Maybe b]
data Unsecure a b =  
  Unsecure (ValidationFunctions a b, a)
 
validate :: Unsecure a b -> Either a [b]

umap :: Unsecure a b -> (a -> a) 
  -> Unsecure a b

upure :: a -> ValidationFunctions a b
  -> Unsecure a b
\end{lstlisting}
Here, \texttt{a} and \texttt{b} represent \textit{every possible} type, as usual in Haskell type definitions. The former is the input type and the latter is an \textit{error} type. Using an error type is necessary, because the validation could fail. If it fails, the error list is returned. Following the Haskell error mechanism, every error in that list is represented as a constructor of the type \texttt{b}. \\
\texttt{Unsecure} is defined as a pair made up of \texttt{ValidationFunctions} (\textit{VF}), from a value of type \texttt{a} to a value of an error type \texttt{b}, and a value of type \texttt{a} (\texttt{v} in the rest of the section). \texttt{validate} simply makes sure \texttt{v} actually meets the \textit{VF} constraints. If so, \texttt{v} is returned; otherwise it returns the error list, since \texttt{v} could fail more than one constraint. This is why \texttt{Either} is required. \\
\texttt{upure} and \texttt{umap} try to simulate an applicative approach. The former allows programmers to create an \texttt{Unsecure} value. The latter allows them to manipulate \texttt{v} before validation. An \texttt{Unsecure} value is supposed to be created by an IO function and manipulated by programmers. It may not be defined as a canonical functor or applicative because of its own nature. Type \texttt{a} must not be changed, because with this definition every validation function is based on it. A feasible solution would be a constrained functor type signature, but this may not be done with normal functors, as well as applicatives. Nevertheless, \citeauthor{Sculthorpe:13:ConstrainedMonad} \cite{Sculthorpe:13:ConstrainedMonad} had shown that this would be achievable with a little effort. There are a lot of other works on this topic, such as Co-Yoneda functor, based on Yoneda Lemma (\cite{elkins2009calculating}, \cite{yoneda}). However, for the sake of simplicity, this work is limited to canonical functor, applicatives and monads. \\
Listing~\ref{unsecureNat} shows how \texttt{Unsecure} can be used for validating strings as natural numbers.
\begin{lstlisting}[label={unsecureNat}, breaklines=true, caption={Unsecure for natural numbers}]
data NatError = NegativeNumber | NonNumeric

getNat :: IO (Unsecure String NatError)
getNat = do n <- getLine
	    return $ upure n [
		isNumeric,
		isNatural
	    ]	   
	    
isNumeric s = if null $ dropWhile isDigit s
              then Nothing
              else Just NonNumeric

isNatural n = if read n >= 0
              then Nothing
              else Just NegativeNumber
              
useNat = do n <- getNat
            case validate n of
              Left nat -> operation nat
              Right es -> showerrors es
\end{lstlisting}
\texttt{getNat} takes a string from the user and constraints that with two functions, \texttt{isNumeric} and \texttt{isNatural}. \texttt{NatError} represents a category of possible errors. Each validation function should have a respective error type. When a user is asked for a natural number an \texttt{IO (Unsecure String NatError)} is given to the programmers instead of an \texttt{IO Int}. Doing so, they can be sure the boxed \texttt{String} actually represents what they want. \\
Even with this minimal example the \texttt{Unsecure} benefits are clear: programmers must validate inputs before using them. As an immediate consequence, many vulnerabilities are called off. As another example, consider a function returning a string and validating it by checking its length. Buffer overflow attacks are based on a poor check of the string length, so by using \texttt{Unsecure} we are sure about the validity of that string. This is possible with a few lines of code.
