Protecting data confidentiality and working on validated values have become increasingly important in modern software. Since the first examples of code injection or buffer overflow attacks, language-based security has improved itself. We have developed a huge amount of techniques for detecting software threats. We have also developed from scratch entire new languages for security purposes. \\
The core idea behind that is to ensure properties by using type theory. With advanced and complex type systems we are able to check for code vulnerabilities at compile time. Nevertheless, learning a new language, or completely migrate to that, is a complex and difficult operation. This is why, over the last few years, researchers have developed new secure libraries for existing languages. \\
The contribute of this paper is twofold. On one hand I lightly build an existing Haskell library up. On the other hand I present two new types for ensuring two important properties: operating on validated input values and performing computations on untainted data.
