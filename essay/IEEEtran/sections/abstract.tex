Protecting confidentiality of data and working on validated values have become increasingly important in modern software. Since the first examples of code injection or buffer overflow attacks, language-based security has improved itself. We have developed a huge amount of techniques for detecting software threats. We have also developed from scratch entire new languages for security purposes. \\
The core idea behind that is to ensure properties by using type theory. With advanced and complex type systems we are able to check at compile time for code vulnerabilities. Nevertheless, learning a new language, or completely migrate to that, is a complex and difficult operation. Most companies will not do that unless they are strongly motivated. This is why, over the last few years, researcher have developed new secure libraries for existing languages. \\
The contribute of this paper is twofold. On one hand I lightly improve an existing Haskell library. On the other hand I introduce two new types for ensuring two important properties: working on validated input values and perform computations on untainted data.
